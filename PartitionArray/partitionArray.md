*[Very Easy]: Arrays, Loops, Conditions*

Given an array of integer, write a program which returns, in ascending order, a partition array for numbers mulitple of 2 or 3 or none of them.Consider the partition of 2 if the number is both a multiple of 2 and 3

__Input__
- `nums`: An array of integer to partition.

__Output__

An *array of array of integers* which contains the partition of mulitple of 2 or 3 or none of them.

__Example__

- For `nums=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]`, the result should be : [[2,4,6,8],[3],[1,5,7]]]
- For `nums=[2,2,3,3]`, the result should be : [[2,2],[3,3],[]]]
