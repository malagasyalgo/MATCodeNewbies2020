**Cows Milk**

*[Very Easy]: Arrays, Loops*

Rajao just bought `n` cows. Each cow produce `cow[i]` of milk every day.
What's the total amount of milk Rajao will get after `d` days of milking
those cows?

__Example__
- For `n = 3`, `cow = [2, 3, 1]`, `d = 5`, the answer should be `30`.

*Guaranteed constraints*
`0 <= n <= 10^5` `0 <= cow[i] <= 10^5` `1 <= d <= 10^5`
