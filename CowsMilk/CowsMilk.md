**Cows Milk**

*[Very Easy]: Arrays, Loops*

Rajao just bought `cow.length` cows. Each cow produce `cow[i]` of milk every day.
What's the total amount of milk Rajao will get after `d` days of milking those cows?

__Example__
- For `cow = [2, 3, 1]`, `d = 5`, the answer should be `30`.

*Guaranteed constraints*
`0 <= cow.length <= 10^5` 
`0 <= cow[i] <= 10^5` 
`1 <= d <= 10^5`
